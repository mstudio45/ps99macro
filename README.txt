requirements are broken
i gave up on this code a long time ago 

you can do whatever you want with it or take inspiration
if you want to make this work i would appreciate if you would credit me (not required but appreciated)

p.s: this is now even gonna launch since i gave up on it during a rewrite (rewards, main.py and maybe other stuff are not recoded and 100% broken)
