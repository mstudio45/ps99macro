> This is a project that I made for myself. A lot of stuff is rushed but my friends wanted to use it so I started recoding it. I totally forgot about this because I stopped playing PS99.
> I made this open source for others to take inspiration. Fell free to recode it or make it work :) (credit is not required but appreciated)
